#### HOW IT WORKS

After that, you‚Äôre ready to embed products anywhere on your WordPress site. Embedding payment forms is just one of the ways SecuraCart makes it easy to get paid.

**Here are all the ways you can use SecuraCart to collect payment:**

- Embed a payment form on your site
- Embed a payment button on your site
- Share the link on social media
- Email the link to a customer
- Text message the link to a customer

#### STRIPE + WORDPRESS HAS NEVER BEEN EASIER

SecuraCart works hard behind the scenes so you don‚Äôt have to. We automatically sync all products and subscription plans to your Stripe account, and create a new customer on every successful checkout. We even track attempted/failed checkouts. This makes it easy for you to understand what's driving growth in your business, and who is making purchases.

**SecuraCart takes care of:**

- Syncing products with Stripe

#### RECURRING REVENUE AND SUBSCRIPTIONS

We know that recurring revenue is the ultimate way to have secure and steady revenue feeding into our business each month. The only problem is that setting it all up and managing it yourself takes a ton of work. You have to create a product in Stripe, and then create Plans, and then have a developer update the existing code. Wouldn't it be nice if it wasn't so difficult?

**Here‚Äôs how SecuraCart makes collecting recurring payments a breeze:**

- Create unlimited plans that automatically sync with your Stripe account
- Hands-free trial management up to 365 days
- ZERO Stripe configuration - we take care of the heavy lifting!
  Offer free trials
- Easily adopt creative pricing strategies
- Stop spending time, energy, and money on pricing pages
- No more custom development costs
- Offer one-time and recurring revenue products
- Display your forms ANYWHERE - Show your forms on blog posts, landing pages, or anywhere else you need them.
